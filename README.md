# RubiKit

Build from source, after you inject the first time there should be a RubiKit folder next to your .dll

Download the .zip from releases and extract it to the RubiKit folder.


Click Modules â†’ Select Folder.
RubiKitOS recursively scans for module.json.
Newly discovered modules appear in the Module Library.
Use Manifest Builder to decide which modules are active.

ðŸ§¾ Manifest Builder (Enable/Disable Modules)

public/manifest.json is the single source of truth that RubiKitOS loads at startup.

In the UI
Open Manifest Builder from the taskbar menu.
Toggle modules on/off (the UI shows discovered modules).
Click Update Manifest to write changes to public/manifest.json.
Use Clear Loaded Modules if you want a clean slate.
